# Drum Kit using JavaScript Sounds - README

## Description
This project is a simple web application that emulates a drum kit using JavaScript sounds. When you press certain keys on your keyboard, corresponding drum sounds will be played, and the key pressed will be displayed on the screen.

## Features
- Interactive drum kit with sound effects
- Visual display of the key pressed
- Easy-to-use and responsive design

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Getting Started
Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
You need to have a web browser installed on your computer to run this project.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/rohitsaini81/Drum-Kit-using-javascript.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Drum-Kit-using-javascript`

### Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Press the keys displayed on the drum kit to hear the corresponding drum sounds.
3. Enjoy making some beats!

## How it Works
When you press a key on your keyboard, a JavaScript event listener captures the keypress and triggers the corresponding drum sound to be played. Additionally, the key pressed is displayed on the screen using DOM manipulation.

## Customize the Sounds
You can easily customize the drum sounds by replacing the audio files located in the `sounds/` directory. Make sure the new audio files are in the `.wav` format for compatibility with most web browsers.
